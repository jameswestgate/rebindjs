Rebind js
=========

A lightweight standards-based model-view-controller library using Mustache templating, focusing on out-the-box developer productivity.
Uses plain Javascript objects to intelligently create and modify DOM elements with two-way model binding.


TODO:

- Create a pattern to work with htm5 validation + older browser polyfills
- Helper to attach / detach event handlers to elements in the template
- Move model context function to the controller
- Link views to controllers
